Hotwire Native is a web-first framework for building native mobile apps.

Hotwire Native provides an answer to all of these drawbacks with its web-first approach. The framework enables you to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and reuse them across every platform. If you already have a Hotwire web app, you can use the screens you've already built!

For showing extensions and the support and services menu we are using our Webkul Services. So, confirming the privacy policies is recommended.
