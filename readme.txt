Hotwire Native is a web-first framework for building native mobile apps.

Hotwire Native provides an answer to all of these drawbacks with its web-first approach. The framework enables you to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and reuse them across every platform. If you already have a Hotwire web app, you can use the screens you've already built!
